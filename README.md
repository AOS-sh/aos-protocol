# AOS Protocol – The .well-known/agent Specification

![AOS Logo](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/245746992?s=200&v=4)

The single JSON file that turns any website into an agent-native surface.  
**No scraping. No breaking. Just structured actions for every AI agent.**

## Why AOS Protocol?

In 1994, `robots.txt` made the web crawlable. In 2025, `/.well-known/agent` makes the web *executable* by agents.

- **For site owners**: Add one file → agents stop hammering your login forms and start converting users better.
- **For agents**: Discover actions, auth, contact in seconds — zero hallucination.
- **For everyone**: The seed of the Agent Operating System (AOS) – a full stack coming soon.

Live example: [bernardo-raposo.com](https://www.bernardo-raposo.com/.well-known/agent.json) – the first agent-native portfolio.

## Quick Start ( >1 Minute )

1. Run on your terminal: npx runaos@latest
2. Update the file according to your needs.
